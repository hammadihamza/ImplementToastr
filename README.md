# ImplementToastr
A little page which contains 4 buttons, I used Toastr library, each button has a different shape and displays different toastr messages.


# Toastr
toastr is a Javascript library for Gnome / Growl type non-blocking notifications. jQuery is required. The goal is to create a simple core library that can be customized and extended.

# Reason behind creating this page:
- Get back to the page whenever I need To use Toastr
- Share it with every one since it makes things a lot easier and way smoother

# How to avoid Problems you might face:
- Include jQuery cdn.
- Put your script tags under jQuery cdn script.
